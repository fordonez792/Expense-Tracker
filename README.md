# Expense-Tracker

With the use of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I created a web application to track monthly expenses. It takes current savings amount and monthly income. It will track and save all expenses, and show the user their total expenses throughout the month. At the end of the month it will reset, saving the total amount saved and spent for future reference.
